Data Structures: 
2D Array : Creating the grid (20 x 10)
vector: to store the colors for cells
map: to craete the blocks [use cells attribute of block class -> map of vector : key -> rotation state and value -> 0 to 3 (4 sides)
]

OOPS:
Abstraction: Achieved as implementation is hidden from other feature codes
Inheritance: Block as base class -> empty block and 7 other blocks with different colors as child blocks, to create the different shapes(check image OOPS-Inheritance) 
Encapsulation: arrow key direction by pressing the arrow key, seperate method/function is created for handling the movement of the block
